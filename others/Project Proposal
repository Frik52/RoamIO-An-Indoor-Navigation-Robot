An Autonomous Robot for Indoor Navigation

Objective:
To design and develop a robot capable of navigating complex indoor environments autonomously using sensor data, mapping algorithms, and obstacle avoidance techniques.

Key Features:
Autonomous Path Planning
Robot identifies optimal paths using algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, or RRT.
Obstacle Detection and Avoidance
Uses sensors (IR, ultrasonic, LIDAR, depth cameras) to detect and bypass obstacles.
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
Builds a map of the environment while tracking its own location using SLAM techniques.
Indoor Positioning System
GPS is unreliable indoors â€” the robot uses odometry, IMU, Wi-Fi triangulation, or visual markers for accurate indoor positioning.
Real-time Decision Making
Processes data continuously to update its path dynamically in response to environmental changes.

Components needed(provisional):
Microcontroller/Processor: Raspberry Pi or Arduino + NVIDIA Jetson (for ML tasks)
Sensors: LIDAR, Ultrasonic sensors, Infrared sensors, IMU
Actuators: DC motors or servo motors for movement
Camera (optional): For visual SLAM or object detection
Software: ROS (Robot Operating System), Python/C++, OpenCV, SLAM libraries (GMapping, Hector SLAM)

Applications:
Indoor delivery (offices, hospitals, hotels)
Surveillance and patrolling
Smart home assistance
Warehouse automation
