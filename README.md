Title: RoamIO
An Autonomous Robot for Indoor Navigation

1. Introduction:
Autonomous robots are transforming industries by reducing the need for manual navigation, especially in indoor environments where GPS is ineffective. This project proposes the design and implementation of an intelligent robot capable of autonomously navigating indoor spaces, avoiding obstacles, and dynamically adapting to its environment using sensor fusion and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technology.

2. Objectives:
Design and build a mobile robot capable of autonomous indoor navigation
Implement real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
Utilize SLAM for map-building and self-localization
Integrate efficient path planning and decision-making algorithms
Ensure adaptability to dynamic and partially unknown environments

3. Problem Statement:
Indoor navigation poses unique challenges due to unreliable GPS signals, unpredictable human movement, and complex layouts. Manual control or pre-defined paths are inefficient in such environments. An autonomous system that can perceive its surroundings, build a map, and make real-time decisions is essential for tasks like indoor delivery, patrolling, and assistance.

4. Scope of the Project:
Navigation within closed spaces like offices, homes, or hospitals
Avoidance of static and dynamic obstacles
Real-time path recalculation when environment changes
Visual or sensor-based mapping (depending on resources)

Exclusions: Outdoor use, stair navigation, voice interaction (optional as extensions)

5. Methodology:
Software Components:
Programming Languages: Python and/or C++
Middleware: ROS (Robot Operating System)
SLAM Algorithm: GMapping, Hector SLAM, or RTAB-Map
Path Planning: A* or Dijkstra algorithm
Obstacle Avoidance: Reactive navigation with sensor fusion
Mapping and Visualization: RViz (ROS Visualization Tool)

5.3 Implementation Steps:
Assemble hardware components

Configure sensors and test raw data accuracy

Implement basic movement and motor control

Integrate SLAM to build and localize in map
Implement obstacle detection and dynamic path planning

Test in varied indoor settings with static and moving obstacles

Evaluate accuracy, reliability, and adaptability

6. Expected Outcome:
A mobile robot that can autonomously explore, map, and navigate indoor environments

Real-time obstacle detection and response
Map generation and self-localization
Demo-ready prototype capable of indoor tasks (e.g., reaching a destination point avoiding barriers)

7. Applications:
Hospitals: Delivery of medicines, documents, or test results
Offices: Internal mail or supply delivery
Warehouses: Navigation and item transport
Homes: Smart robotic assistants for elderly or disabled
