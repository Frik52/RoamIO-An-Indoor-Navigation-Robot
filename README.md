# RoamIO
📌 Overview

This project is a robot navigation simulation built in Unity with support for both 2D and 3D environments.
The robot autonomously navigates from a start point to a user-selected destination using the A* pathfinding algorithm, while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles.

Features include interactive destination setting, real-time obstacle avoidance, and a smooth camera system that follows the robot in motion.

🎯 Key Features

  🚦 Autonomous Robot Navigation (2D + 3D modes)
  
  🧭 A* Pathfinding with obstacle avoidance
  
  🖱️ Interactive target selection via clicks/taps
  
  📷 Smart Camera: overhead → follow → return
  
  🧱 Static & Dynamic Obstacles (walls, NPCs, doors)
  
  🌍 Indoor 3D environment + Top-down 2D grid

🖥️ Demo Workflow

  Launch simulation → Camera starts overhead.
  
  User clicks a target location.
  
  Robot calculates shortest path using A*.
  
  Robot moves, avoiding obstacles in real time.
  
  Camera follows robot → returns to overhead when idle.
